Julia Talk on Meta-Modeling, Meta-Plotting, and Direct Feedback Alignment
=========================================================================

### Overview

These are collections of tutorials from my Meetup talks to demonstrate [Julia's] (http://julialang.org) capability. 

To get all the files: git clone https://github.com/ppalmes/JuliaTalkFeb2017.git

You must install [iJulia] (https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) if you want to play/edit/extend/update the tutorials.
